# linux_files

This repository contains my personal linux configs and text data from other linux programs I use.

Configurations for the next programs included:

* i3 window manager
* sway
* i3blocks
* Neovim
* xmonad
* git
* zsh

Also included:

* my little scripts which I use in tiling window managers. These scripts are probably too tied to my own machines for being used by other people but check them out if interested.
* scripts for automatic installation of these configs and Arch installation
* symlinks to some of my directories (mainly, browser data and cache for convenience between reinstalls)
* some wallpapers
